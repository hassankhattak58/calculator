# calculator
Calculator app designed and developed by PERDEV-Hassan Khattak.

Designed and Developed Using:
1. HTML 
2. CSS
3. JS

The code is clean and easy to understand and some explanation is given Below:

1. Getting Values: Get the values of the button that is pressed and call function set() passing it that value.
2. Setting Values: Set the values of the key on the screen. First, it will check if there is any number key pressed or a function key pressed, if number key is pressed it will simply concat the number and will display it on the screen else if the function key is pressed it will check previous value if there is any other function used before it, if yes it will replace the older function with the new one.
3. Calculation: In the calc() function it will first check the initial char of the string if it is a number or + or - it will do nothing otherwise it will remove the initial function.
